# Project Title

Angular Cross Skilling EgFWD, this is a project to show case skills in Angular Framework.
It is an e-commerce store website, fetch the inventory products from a json file, checkout page with validation and a confirmation page.

## Getting Started

The usual stuff, clone, cd to the cloned folder then run ```npm install```, if you're on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) then you can run ```command``` and ``` code . ``` from there.

```
https://github.com/imonem/udacity-angular-x-skill.git
```

### Prerequisites

I used [angular-notifier-updated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-notifier-updated) to display styled notification rather than the blocking ```window.alert```

For the styling, I used [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)


### Installing

Open a ```terminal``` window or a ```cmd``` or ```powershell```

Copy and paste the below line

```
https://github.com/imonem/udacity-angular-x-skill.git
```

Once done, then cd to the folder created

```
cd udacity-angular-x-skill
```
then type the below

```npm install```

once done, then type

```ng serve --port 3000```

Open your favorite browser and surf to

```http://localhost:3000```
